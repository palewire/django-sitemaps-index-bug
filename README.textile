h1. Django Sitemaps Bug

This Django project is meant to demonstrate a bug I've encountered while using the otherwise wonderful django.contrib.sitemaps.

Here's the nut: If I try to use the "index" sitemap for more than one app, everything goes haywire and they start overwriting each other.

To see what I mean, download the app and visit the two following urls:

<pre><code>http://localhost:8000/app1/sitemap.xml
http://localhost:8000/app2/sitemap.xml</code></pre>

What you'll see is that both of the pagination url sets point to the app2 subdirectory.

This seems to be caused by the fact that I'm not calling a single sitemap index from the root urls file,
but instead calling two, one from each app's urlset. 

Maybe this is the wrong way to use sitemaps, and I can be ignored, but I think the problem happens in line 17 of "django.contrib.sitemaps.views":http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/trunk/django/contrib/sitemaps/views.py where the url is reversed.

Finally, I had this problem with Django 1.1, though I imagine it still would occur in 1.2 and later.
